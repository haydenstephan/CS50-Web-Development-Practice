          Hey what's going on? My name is Hayden Stephan, and welcome to my webpage. Here, I want to put up a bunch of
          random stuff I like. I like philosophy of religion and am earning my PhD in that at St Louis University. I
          also like coding, which is awesome and just the most cutting-edge thing. I also like random fun things like
          Pokemon, Fire Emblem, and Harry Potter. So I also have a little blog on the side.
